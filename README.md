# Todo-App(DOM Only)
This is a basic To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses only DOM manipulation (no frameworks or libraries).

#What it does:
Lets you add tasks

Lets you mark tasks as completed

Lets you delete tasks

#How it works:
When you type a task and click Add, a new list item is created using document.createElement().

You can click on a task to mark it as done (toggled with a class).

Each task also has a Delete button to remove it using removeChild().

Files:
#index.html – the structure of the app

#style.css – basic styling

#script.js – handles everything with plain JavaScript and DOM

#How to use:
Download or clone this repository.

Open index.html in your browser.

Start adding your tasks!

No installations, no frameworks — just open and use.
